# Data-Driven Climate Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project explores and predicts temperature changes from 2000 to 2080 using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and machine learning models. We analyze various climate projections to understand trends, patterns, and potential future changes in temperature.

## Presentation
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pSRMX2lFIvA6DZj1SmAwuPv-CnYbqUPT6mUSI6Ty9oM/edit?usp=sharing

## Research Questions
- How do different climate variables behave across various climate projections?
- Which variables exhibit the greatest changes between the early and future decades?
- How do machine learning and statistical models compare in predicting temperature time series from climate projections?

## Data Sources
- The `.nc` files contain climate projection data from 2006 to 2080.
- `finalquarterlyghgemissions.xlsx` provides quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, use:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate climate_forecasting
```

## Usage
1. Run the notebooks in sequence for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
2. Use `run_notebooks.py` to execute all notebooks in one go.
3. Modify `helper.py` for additional data processing functions.

## Results & Insights
- Key climate variables were identified and analyzed over time.
- Machine learning models, particularly LSTMs, were used to predict temperature trends.
- Comparisons between statistical and ML models provided insights into forecasting accuracy.
